AR,367,"The androgen receptor gene is more than 90 kb long and codes for a protein that has 3 major functional domains: the N-terminal domain, DNA-binding domain, and androgen-binding domain. The protein functions as a steroid-hormone activated transcription factor.

This gene contains 2 polymorphic trinucleotide repeat segments that encode polyglutamine and polyglycine tracts in the N-terminal transactivation domain of its protein. Expansion of the polyglutamine tract from the normal 9-34 repeats to the pathogenic 38-62 repeats causes spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, also known as Kennedy's disease).

This recombination hotspot is found within the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1), so the DNA sequence is present on both the X chromosome and Y chromosome at Xp22 and Yp11, respectively. This region is highly recombinogenic in males, and studies have shown that there is an obligatory crossover in the PAR1 region per male meiosis, while the recombination rate in the region in females is similar to the genome-wide recombination average. Reduced recombination in this region can lead to aneuploidy sperm, and can be a cause of Turner syndrome (XO) or Kleinfelter syndrome (XXY) in the offspring. Studies in mice indicate that recombination in the PAR region occurs at later times than that observed on autosomes.

The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]",from 50008431 to 50008514 bases on chromosome X of homo sapience

NAHR between these regions can result in genomic rearrangements, including inversions and deletions. Rearrangements that disrupt the IDS (iduronate 2-sulfatase) gene can be a cause of Hunter syndrome (also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type II, MPS-II). Genomic structural rearrangements have been observed in about 20% of individuals with Hunter syndrome. This region is composed of multiple sub-regions that have been identified as NAHR exchange sites in different individuals, and also contains an overlapping meiotic recombination hotspot. The NAHR exchange sub-regions are named a1, a2, and b. NAHR involving the a1 and a2 sub-regions have been observed in individuals with inversions, while exchanges in the b sub-region have been observed in deletion rearrangements. Hunter syndrome is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiencies of the iduronate sulfatase enzyme, leading to the build-up of mucopolysaccharides in bodily tissues.

Members of this family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation. This gene appears to represent an intronless retrocopy of a related multi-exon gene located on chromosome 9. However, the CDS of this intronless gene remains intact, it is conserved in other mammalian species, it is known to be transcribed, and it is therefore thought to encode a functional protein.

This recombination region is located within inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma pseudogene 1 (IKBKGP1) and is part of a larger 35 kb low-copy repeat known as LCR2, while the IKBKG recombination region is found within LCR1. Copy number variation (CNV) due to NAHR events between misaligned Medium Reiterated 67B (MER67B) repeat units involving the repeat about 11 kb upstream of this region, in direct orientation, have been observed and result in duplications (known as MER6Bdup) and deletions (known as IKBKGPdel) of the intervening sequence. While these CNVs are benign, it has been suggested the presence of these alleles could promote other recombination events that result in the pathological IKBKGdel deletion, which removes a portion of the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG) gene. Recombination between this region and the IKBKG recombination region, found in reverse orientation within LCR1, has also been observed. Gene conversion events that result in the unidirectional transfer of genetic information from the IKBKGP1 pseudogene to the IKBKG locus can introduce pathological mutations to the IKBKG gene. It has been suggested that inversion events between these recombination regions can also occur. Alterations that result in a non-functional IKBKG gene are a cause of incontinentia pigmenti (IP), and X-linked neuroectodermal disorder that causes lethality in males.

OR3B1P,392561,"Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.

The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

This recombination region is part of a larger 35 kb low-copy repeat (LCR) known as LCR2. A similar 35 kb low-copy repeat, LCR1, is found about 80 kb upstream of this region, relative to the reference genome. Copy number variation (CNV) due to NAHR events between misaligned Medium Reiterated 67B (MER67B) repeat units in this region and the IKBKGP1 recombination region have been observed and result in duplications (known as MER6Bdup) and deletions (known as IKBKGPdel) of the intervening sequence. While these CNVs are benign, it has been suggested the presence of these alleles could promote other recombination events that result in the pathological IKBKGdel deletion, which removes a portion of the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG) gene. Alterations that result in a non-functional IKBKG gene are a cause of incontinentia pigmenti (IP), and X-linked neuroectodermal disorder that causes lethality in males.

It was validated as an active enhancer by reporter assays in K562 erythroleukemia cells. Multiple overlapping subregions were validated as cis-regulatory elements by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbation in K562 cells, where one subregion was shown to regulate the GATA1 (GATA binding protein 1) gene with high confidence and the CCDC22 (coiled-coil domain containing 22) gene with lower confidence, another subregion was validated as a positively-acting regulatory element for GATA1 and a negatively-acting regulatory element for PLP2 (proteolipid protein 2), while another subregion was shown to be a regulatory element for both GATA1 and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6).

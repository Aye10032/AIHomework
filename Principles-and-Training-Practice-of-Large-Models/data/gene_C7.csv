Each T cell receptor is a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents the germline organization of the T cell receptor gamma locus. The gamma locus includes V (variable), J (joining), and C (constant) segments. During T cell development, the gamma chain is synthesized by a recombination event at the DNA level joining a V segment with a J segment; the C segment is later joined by splicing at the RNA level. Recombination of many different V segments with several J segments provides a wide range of antigen recognition. Additional diversity is attained by junctional diversity, resulting from the random addition of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Several V segments of the gamma locus are known to be incapable of encoding a protein and are considered pseudogenes.

ZP3,7784,"The zona pellucida is an extracellular matrix that surrounds the oocyte and early embryo. It is composed primarily of three or four glycoproteins with various functions during fertilization and preimplantation development.

The nascent protein contains a N-terminal signal peptide sequence, a conserved ZP domain, a C-terminal consensus furin cleavage site, and a transmembrane domain. It is hypothesized that furin cleavage results in release of the mature protein from the plasma membrane for subsequent incorporation into the zona pellucida matrix. However, the requirement for furin cleavage in this process remains controversial based on mouse studies. A variation in the last exon of this gene has previously served as the basis for an additional ZP3 locus; however, sequence and literature review reveals that there is only one full-length ZP3 locus in the human genome. Another locus encoding a bipartite transcript designated POMZP3 contains a duplication of the last four exons of ZP3, including the above described variation, and maps closely to this gene.

MIR671,768213,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

This region is activated by xenobiotics and glucocorticoids, and is stimulated by binding of forkhead box A2, Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors, upstream transcription factor 1, nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I members, and nuclear factor I to the proximal promoter. A subregion was also validated as an active enhancer by the STARR-seq (self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing) massively parallel reporter assay in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells, where it was defined as a group 3 enhancer that depends on the BRD2, BRD4, P300/CBP and CDK7 cofactors, but it has limited or no dependence on the MED14 core Mediator complex subunit. The 5' regulatory regions of CYP3 family members, including CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, are highly similar at the sequence level but have subtle differences in function. A subregion was also shown to be an enhancer by the ChIP-STARR-seq massively parallel reporter assay in primed human embryonic stem cells, where it associates with the OCT4 and NANOG transcription factors.

Each DHS can bind to the HNF1alpha transcription factor. This region was shown to interact physically with the CFTR promoter. A conserved sub-region, CR21, was shown to function as both a silencer and an enhancer-blocking element in transfected K562 cells. It strongly repressed a gamma-globin promoter coupled to the HS2 beta-globin enhancer, and also modestly repressed an SV40 promoter coupled to the HS2 enhancer, when present in the forward orientation in the reporter construct. The CR21 sub-region could also modestly block HS2 enhancer activation of the SV40 promoter when located between the enhancer and promoter in the reverse orientation in the reporter construct. Two CT-motifs that are present in the CR21 element were shown to contribute to its silencing function.

Four human Y RNAs have been identified: Y1, Y3 (RNY3; MIM 601822), Y4 (RNY4; MIM 601823), and Y5 (RNY5; MIM 601824). (Y2 is a truncated form of Y1.) Y RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase III and range in size from 83 to 112 nucleotides. They appear to have a functional role in chromosomal DNA replication (Christov et al., 2006 [PubMed 16943439]).[supplied by OMIM, Apr 2009]",from 148987136 to 148987248 bases on chromosome 7 of homo sapience

MIR591,693176,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

LOC108228209,108228209,"This region is known to undergo non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) with another region, the 7q11.23 proximal recombination region, found about 1.2 Mb centromere-proximal to this region, in direct orientation relative to this region. This region is found within a GC-rich region of a low-copy repeat, known as the distal HIP1-LCR. NAHR between this region and the 7q11.23 proximal recombination region can result in deletions and duplications of the intervening sequence. Since both of these regions are located centromere-distal to the Williams-Beuren syndrome recombination regions, the 1.2 Mb deletion that can result from NAHR between this region and the 7q11.23 distal recombination region is known as the distal 7q11.23 deletion. This deletion involves multiple genes, including the huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein gamma (YWHAG) genes. Phenotypic consequences of the deletion can include developmental delays, epilepsy and neurobehavioral problems, but incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity has been observed. A recombination breakpoint from individuals with the genomic rearrangement is indicated as an NAHR sub-region on the record.

LOC108228208,108228208,"This region is known to undergo non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) with another region, the 7q11.23 distal recombination region, found about 1.2 Mb centromere-distal to this region, in direct orientation relative to this region. This region is found within a GC-rich region of a low-copy repeat, known as the proximal HIP1-LCR. NAHR between this region and the 7q11.23 distal recombination region can result in deletions and duplications of the intervening sequence. Since both of these regions are located centromere-distal to the Williams-Beuren syndrome recombination regions, the 1.2 Mb deletion that can result from NAHR between this region and the 7q11.23 distal recombination region is known as the distal 7q11.23 deletion. This deletion involves multiple genes, including the huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein gamma (YWHAG) genes. Phenotypic consequences of the deletion can include developmental delays, epilepsy and neurobehavioral problems, but incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity has been observed. A recombination breakpoint from individuals with the genomic rearrangement is indicated as an NAHR sub-region on the record.
